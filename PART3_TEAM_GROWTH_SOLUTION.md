# Part 3: Team Growth Strategy - Scaling from 5 to 15 Engineers

## **Why This Scenario**

Chosen because it's the most common leadership challenge in high-growth companies - demonstrates both technical systems thinking and people leadership.

## **Core Challenge**

Scale analytics team 3x in 6 months without losing code quality or team culture.

## **Strategic Approach**

### **Key Decision: Team Organisation**

**Choice**: Domain-focused squads (Customer Analytics, Product Analytics, Commercial Analytics)
**Why**: Aligns with business needs, develops deep domain expertise, clear stakeholder ownership
**Trade-off**: Some skill siloing vs business alignment, but enables stronger partnerships

### **Key Decision: Quality Gates**

**Choice**: Hybrid automated + human review process
**Why**: Automation scales, humans provide learning opportunities
**Implementation**: Complex changes get senior review, simple changes auto-approved

### **Key Decision: Knowledge Transfer**

**Choice**: Structured mentorship (buddy + senior mentor) vs informal learning
**Why**: Predictable onboarding, preserves institutional knowledge
**Structure**:

- Buddy (daily questions, pair programming)
- Senior mentor (weekly 1:1s, career development)

## **What I'd Build First** (Month 1-2)

1. **Code standards documentation** - Clear guidelines before hiring starts
2. **Review process workflow** - Who reviews what, when, and how
3. **Onboarding checklist** - 30-60-90 day progression with clear milestones
4. **Squad structure** - Define domain boundaries, roles, and collaboration patterns

## **What I'd Measure**

**Leading Indicators**:

- Time to first merged PR (<1 week)
- Onboarding satisfaction scores
- Code review turnaround time

**Success Metrics**:

- 90% test coverage maintained
- <60 days to independent productivity
- > 4.0/5 team satisfaction in surveys

## **Biggest Risks & Mitigation**

**Risk**: Knowledge siloed in domain squads
**Mitigation**: Mandatory documentation, tech talks, cross-squad code reviews, shared standards

**Risk**: Quality degradation during rapid hiring
**Mitigation**: Automated quality gates, senior review for complex changes

**Risk**: Communication overhead between squads
**Mitigation**: Clear domain ownership, regular cross-squad sync meetings, shared tooling and standards

---

## **What I'd Do Differently at 30 Engineers**

- **Sub-squads**: Split large domains (e.g., Customer Analytics into Acquisition/Retention squads)
- **Management layers**: Squad leads and staff engineers for people management
- **Process formalisation**: More structured RFC process and architecture review boards

---

**This approach balances systematic process design with practical implementation - focusing on sustainable growth rather than comprehensive frameworks.**
